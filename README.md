# Code Format Guidelines
This repo contains the [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) style files (as well as other guides such as naming conventions)
which I use for my personal projects.

**Disclaimer**: At the moment it is very basic, full of holes, and probably of no use to anyone but myself.

## Languages:
* [C/C++](c-cpp/c-cpp.md)
